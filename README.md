# Trapezoidal_Method_Parallelized

In this repository, I will be providing a parallelized version of the trapezoidal method for integral approximation, and I will be calculating the execution time of the parallel code and the sequential code, then caluclating the speed-up factor to view the efficiency of this algorithim.
